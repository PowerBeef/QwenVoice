# Qwen3-TTS for Mac - Run AI Text-to-Speech Locally on Apple Silicon

Run **Qwen3-TTS** text-to-speech AI locally on your MacBook with Apple Silicon (M1, M2, M3, M4). No cloud, no API keys, completely offline.

**Keywords:** Qwen TTS Mac, Qwen3 TTS Apple Silicon, MLX text to speech, local TTS Mac, voice cloning Mac, AI voice generator MacBook

## Features

- **Voice Cloning** - Clone any voice from a 5-second audio sample
- **Voice Design** - Create new voices by describing them ("deep narrator", "excited child")
- **Custom Voices** - 9 built-in voices with emotion and speed control
- **100% Local** - Runs entirely on your Mac, no internet required
- **Optimized for M-Series** - Uses Apple's MLX framework for fast GPU inference

## Why MLX Models?

MLX models are specifically optimized for Apple Silicon. Compared to running standard PyTorch models:

| Metric | Standard Model | MLX Model |
|--------|----------------|-----------|
| **RAM Usage** | 10+ GB | 2-3 GB |
| **CPU Temperature** | 80-90°C | 40-50°C |

*Tested on M4 MacBook Air (fanless) with 1.7B models*

MLX runs natively on the Apple Neural Engine and GPU, meaning better performance with less heat and battery drain.

## Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### 1. Clone and setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PowerBeef/QwenVoice.git
cd QwenVoice/QwenVoice/cli
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
brew install ffmpeg
```

### 2. Download models

**Pro Models (1.7B) - Best Quality**

| Model | Use Case | Download |
|-------|----------|----------|
| CustomVoice | Preset voices + emotion control | [Download](https://huggingface.co/mlx-community/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-CustomVoice-8bit) |
| VoiceDesign | Create voices from text description | [Download](https://huggingface.co/mlx-community/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-VoiceDesign-8bit) |
| Base | Voice cloning from audio | [Download](https://huggingface.co/mlx-community/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-Base-8bit) |

Put downloaded folders in `models/`:
```

├── Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-CustomVoice-8bit/
├── Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-VoiceDesign-8bit/
└── Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-Base-8bit/
```

### 3. Run

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python main.py
```

## Usage

```
========================================
 Qwen3-TTS Manager
========================================

  1. Custom Voice
  2. Voice Design
  3. Voice Cloning

  q. Exit

Select:
```

- **Custom Voice**: Pick from preset speakers, set emotion and speed
- **Voice Design**: Describe a voice (e.g., "calm British narrator")
- **Voice Cloning**: Provide a reference audio clip to clone

---

## Tips

- Drag `.txt` files directly into the terminal for long text
- Voice cloning works best with clean 5-10 second audio clips
- Speed options: Normal (1.0x), Fast (1.3x), Slow (0.8x)
- Type `q` or `exit` anytime to go back

---

## Requirements

- macOS with Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4)
- Python 3.11+ (prefers 3.13)
- RAM: ~6GB for Pro models

---

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| `mlx_audio not found` | Run `source .venv/bin/activate` first |
| `Model not found` | Check model folder names match exactly |
| Audio won't play | Check macOS sound output settings |
