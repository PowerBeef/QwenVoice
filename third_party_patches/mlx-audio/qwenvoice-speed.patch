This repository vendors `mlx-audio` as a repacked wheel rather than rebuilding
the full source tree.

The QwenVoice-specific patch consists of injecting:

- `mlx_audio/qwenvoice_speed_patch.py`

from:

- `third_party_patches/mlx-audio/qwenvoice_speed_patch.py`

and then repacking the upstream `mlx-audio==0.3.1` wheel as
`mlx-audio==0.3.1.post1`.

Use:

- [build_mlx_audio_wheel.sh](/Users/patricedery/Coding_Projects/QwenVoice/scripts/build_mlx_audio_wheel.sh)

to reproduce the vendored wheel.
