# Smoke Runbook: Saved Voices surface lists and plays `UITestRef`

Lightweight functional smoke that exercises the Saved Voices library: the screen mounts, the `UITestRef` fixture is listed, and clicking its play button triggers playback.

Companion reference: [`ui-test-surface.md`](ui-test-surface.md).

## Prerequisites

- Debug build present.
- macOS Accessibility permission granted to Codex.
- The `UITestRef` saved-voice fixture exists. `scripts/uitest.sh smoke-check clone` should exit 0. If not, run [`bootstrap-saved-voice.md`](bootstrap-saved-voice.md) first.

## Fixed inputs

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Saved voice name asserted | `UITestRef` |
| Expected list state | ≥ 1 row (the fixture); voice quality warning may be present (short reference) |

## Steps

1. **Precondition**: `scripts/uitest.sh smoke-check clone`. Abort on non-zero.
2. **Reset**: `scripts/uitest.sh reset` (keeps voices/ — the fixture survives).
3. **Artifacts + log capture**:
   ```sh
   ART=$(scripts/uitest.sh artifacts-dir)
   (scripts/uitest.sh logs > "$ART/log.txt" 2>&1 &)
   LOG_PID=$!
   ```
4. **Launch**: `scripts/uitest.sh prep`.
5. **Access**: `mcp__computer_use__get_app_state(app: "Vocello")`.
6. **Navigate to Saved Voices**:
   - `scripts/uitest.sh window-locate sidebar_voices` → `mcp__computer_use__click`.
   - Verify with `scripts/uitest.sh locate screen_voices` (exit 0).
   - `/usr/sbin/screencapture -x "$ART/pre.png"`.
7. **Verify the `UITestRef` row is present**:
   - `scripts/uitest.sh locate voicesRow_UITestRef` — must return non-empty. The voice id is the (sanitized) display name, not a uuid, so the fixture's id is literally `UITestRef`.
   - The list MAY show a quality-warning badge (short reference clip; expected for the bootstrap fixture). If present, it carries id `voicesRow_UITestRef_qualityWarning`.
8. **Click the row's play affordance**:
   - `scripts/uitest.sh window-locate voicesRow_play_UITestRef` → `mcp__computer_use__click`.
   - Confirm playback by inspecting the sidebar Player section (the reference audio should start playing; takes ~1 s to render).
9. **Use the voice in cloning** (optional bonus check):
   - `scripts/uitest.sh window-locate voicesRow_use_UITestRef` → click. If this switches the sidebar selection to Voice Cloning AND `voiceCloning_savedVoicePicker` shows `UITestRef`, that confirms the "use" flow.
10. **Post-screenshot + tear down**: `/usr/sbin/screencapture -x "$ART/post.png"`, then `kill "$LOG_PID" 2>/dev/null || true`.
11. **Write `$ART/result.json`** with:
    - `pass`: true if (a) `voicesRow_UITestRef` resolves, (b) `voicesRow_play_UITestRef` resolves and the click starts playback
    - `screen`: `voices`
    - `rows_visible`: count of saved-voice rows visible
    - `quality_warning_present`: bool
    - `timestamp`
12. **Report** $ART/ and pass/fail to the user.

## Notes

- This runbook does NOT enroll a new voice or delete the fixture — both would corrupt the test fixture used by Voice Cloning. Those flows can be exercised by separate runbooks if needed.
- The "quality warning" present on `UITestRef` is expected — the bootstrap reference is shorter than the 10-second recommendation. This isn't a failure; it's a warning the saved-voice library surfaces and we acknowledge.
- Row + per-row-action AX ids are canonical (`voicesRow_<voiceID>`, `voicesRow_play_<voiceID>`, `voicesRow_use_<voiceID>`, `voicesRow_delete_<voiceID>`). Visual fallback is no longer expected — if `locate` fails for a known id, treat that as a regression.
