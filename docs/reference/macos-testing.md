# macOS testing — Computer Use frontend + typed runtime probes

macOS testing has two deliberately separate proof layers:

1. `$vocello-macos-ui-qa` is the sole frontend driver. Codex Computer Use operates the
   exact `build/Vocello.app`, observes fresh accessibility state before and after each action,
   and records semantic visual/accessibility findings.
2. Deterministic scripts and typed telemetry prove XPC, backend, persistence, and output
   behavior. A visual observation alone never proves generation completion.

iOS is not part of this migration. Its physical-device XCUITest gates remain authoritative.

## Prerequisites

- Xcode 26 and the Metal Toolchain component.
- `./scripts/build.sh build` has produced `build/Vocello.app`.
- Speed models are available for real-generation suites:
  `scripts/macos_test.sh models ensure`.
- Codex Computer Use has macOS Accessibility and Screen Recording permission.
- System Settings/TCC enrollment and first-time microphone permission are attended setup.

## Public lanes

| Lane | Command | Proof |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Deterministic tests | `scripts/macos_test.sh test` | Core/output/telemetry tests, injectable XPC transport tests, owned Qwen3 runtime tests, harness contracts; no UI driving |
| Core only | `scripts/macos_test.sh core-test` | `VocelloCoreTests`, including schema-v6 and atomic-WAV contracts |
| UI impact | `scripts/macos_agent_ui.sh impact` | Required evidence level: `none`, `quick`, `full`, or `benchmark` |
| UI report | `scripts/macos_test.sh ui-report --suite quick\|full\|benchmark` | Validates a fresh Computer Use report, typed probes, fingerprints, findings, and cleanup |
| Semantic review | `scripts/macos_test.sh review [--report <run>]` | Compatibility alias requiring a valid full report |
| UI benchmark | `scripts/macos_test.sh bench-ui [--report <run>]` | Valid benchmark report plus merged XPC/backend take matrix |
| XPC support | `scripts/macos_test.sh xpc status\|kill\|wait` | Process observation/mutation used inside the full Computer Use suite |
| Gate | `scripts/macos_test.sh gate` | Inputs, build, deterministic tests, crashes, then impact-selected attestation |

The removed `journey`, `uitest-doctor`, `VocelloMacUITests`, runner-signing, and hidden
`QWENVOICE_UI_TEST_HOOKS` workflows must not be revived.

## Computer Use suites

Invoke the repository skill directly in Codex:

```text
$vocello-macos-ui-qa quick
$vocello-macos-ui-qa full
$vocello-macos-ui-qa benchmark
$vocello-macos-ui-qa destructive
```

| Suite | Budget | Coverage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Quick | at most 10 minutes | Exact launch, navigation, Custom generation/playback/history replay, semantic layout/copy/state/accessibility review |
| Full | 30–40 minutes with warm models | Quick plus Design, Clone, batch, controls, History/Saved Voices, reversible Settings, reference import, XPC kill/recovery and post-recovery generation |
| Benchmark | matrix-owned | Computer Use drives Custom/Design/Clone × length × cold/warm; shell timestamps, telemetry and aggregation remain deterministic |
| Destructive | explicit only | History/voice deletion and model cancel/repair/delete/download; requires `--allow-destructive` plus action-time Computer Use confirmation |

The scenario source of truth is
[`config/macos-ui-scenarios.json`](../../config/macos-ui-scenarios.json). The skill must:

- target the exact absolute `build/Vocello.app` path;
- obtain a fresh accessibility tree before and after every logical action;
- resolve fresh element indices and prefer stable `accessibilityIdentifier` values;
- record screenshot/coordinate fallbacks as automation warnings;
- continue independent scenarios after nonblocking findings;
- always perform idempotent cleanup.

## Session and evidence contract

[`scripts/macos_agent_ui.sh`](../../scripts/macos_agent_ui.sh) owns repeatable lifecycle and
verification:

```text
doctor
start --suite quick|full|benchmark|destructive [--allow-destructive]
now
benchmark-manifest
benchmark-take --index <n> --phase begin|complete|fail
checkpoint
issue
verify-generation
verify-history
verify-probes
xpc-status | xpc-kill | xpc-wait
finish
cleanup
validate-report
attest
impact
```

`start` terminates stale app/service processes, resets only isolated debug history/output,
preserves models and saved voices, enables verbose telemetry, launches one exact-path app
process, and records source/build/app fingerprints. Evidence stays ignored under
`build/macos/agent-ui/<run-id>/`; the compact tracked attestation is
[`qa/macos-ui-attestation.json`](../../qa/macos-ui-attestation.json).

For `benchmark`, the manifest command returns the canonical 29 take definitions. Each ordered
`begin` stamps the run ID and current cell into telemetry (and exact-path relaunches the two cold cells),
while `complete` refuses to advance until the matching database row and readable WAV have been
recorded by `verify-generation`.

A report fails when it is blocked, contains a blocker/major issue, lacks a typed probe layer,
has stale source/build/app fingerprints, uses an insufficient suite, or fails cleanup.

## Typed middle/backend proof

Schema-v6 `GenerationTelemetryRecord` rows retain v1–v5 decoding and legacy dictionaries for
tool compatibility, while validators consume:

- `FrontendGenerationMetrics`
- `EngineTransportMetrics`
- `BackendGenerationMetrics`
- `GenerationOutputMetrics`

The engine-service row records an opaque session identity, accepted/forwarded chunk evidence,
first/last sequence, gaps, duplicates, reordering, cancellation/terminal state, and duration.
The backend row records warm state, lifecycle stages, typed timing/counters, terminal reason,
final-chunk barrier, output publication, readability, memory and audio QC.

`verify-probes` joins rows by `generationID` and rejects missing or duplicate terminal rows,
non-monotonic stages, terminal disagreement, gaps/duplicates/reordering, transport completion
before backend terminal evidence, and a completed stream without its final barrier. Separate
generation/history assertions require the matching database row and a readable, non-empty WAV.
No telemetry row stores raw user script, transcript, voice description, or file path.

## Deterministic risk spine

[`config/backend-risk-spine.json`](../../config/backend-risk-spine.json) links the corrected
report IDs to current symbols and executable coverage. The first owned targets are:

- `VocelloCoreTests`: telemetry schema/legacy decoding and atomic readable WAV publication.
- `VocelloEngineIntegrationTests`: request/reply correlation, timeout cleanup, cancellation
  ordering, expected retirement, interruption and reconnection using injectable transport.
- vendored `Qwen3RuntimeTests`: FIFO/cancellation/stress generation-gate behavior, learned
  component fail-closed behavior, and clone artifact integrity.
- Python harness contracts: scenario/impact/report behavior and malformed cross-layer fixtures.

The source report directory is research evidence and remains unchanged; automation consumes the
compact manifest rather than parsing prose.

## Gate and CI behavior

```sh
scripts/macos_test.sh gate
```

The gate runs project-input checks, builds, deterministic tests and crash checks, then calls the
impact classifier. `none` requires no UI report; the other levels require a matching fresh
attestation. Headless CI can run deterministic tests and validate attestation schema/fingerprints,
but it does not claim to execute Computer Use.

## XPC and crash diagnostics

The XPC service is lazy, retireable and crash-isolated. The full Computer Use suite kills it,
waits for absence/relaunch, and requires a successful generation after recovery. Use:

```sh
scripts/macos_test.sh xpc status
scripts/macos_test.sh xpc kill
scripts/macos_test.sh xpc wait --present --timeout 60
scripts/macos_test.sh crashes
scripts/macos_test.sh logs
scripts/macos_test.sh profile custom:speed
```

Crash reports remain gate-fatal when new `.ips` files appear.
