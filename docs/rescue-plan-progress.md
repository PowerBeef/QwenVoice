## 1. Current state (2026-07-02, `main` @ 761c1a4)

### Done and verified


| Area                    | What landed                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Key commits          |

### Also done: AppModel migration Phases 3b/5/6 (landed in `0df766b` + `411ce84`)

All migration phase comments in `Sources/iOS/App/AppModel.swift` now read
"complete-as-designed" — that is the final architecture, not a TODO:

- **3b:** engine calls deliberately stay in the per-mode views (they need four
environment-owned stores that predate `AppModel`); shared cancel lives in
`IOSStudioGenerationActions`.
- **5:** no `presentedSheet` enum (surfaces have different payloads/hosting);
the real fix was pairing the delete-model sheet with the focus backdrop via
`AppModel.presentDeleteModelSheet/dismissDeleteModelSheet`. System modals
(fileImporter/alerts/dialogs) intentionally remain local `@State`.
- **6:** `HistoryScreen`/`SettingsScreen` own their bodies; `IOSLibraryViews.swift`
and `IOSSettingsContainerView` deleted (the Voices-library branch was dead code —
live Voices tab is `IOSVoicesView`). All protected identifiers survive verbatim
(`docs/reference/ui-test-surface.md` regenerated); the only removed ids were the
dead branch's `savedVoiceMenu_*`/`savedVoiceDeleteConfirm_*`, unreferenced by tests.

Compile-verified (`build_foundation_targets.sh ios` BUILD SUCCEEDED). On-device
`scripts/ios_device.sh test` NOT yet run post-migration — fold into step A1 below.

### Current performance reference (like-for-like lanes — NEVER mix)

## 2. NEXT ACTIONS — do these IN ORDER (handout for the continuing model)

> Written 2026-07-02 ~14:20 for the Composer 2.5 handoff. Everything up to commit
> `761c1a4` is pushed. Do the steps below exactly; each has its own verification.
> If a step fails twice the same way, STOP and report — do not improvise new tools.

### Step 1 — Read the J1 verification result (macOS, no phone needed)

A `scripts/macos_test.sh bench-ui --label "j1-verify-round3"` run was IN FLIGHT at
handoff (log: `/tmp/bench-ui-j5.log`, ~20 min). When it prints the gate line:

- `expected=29 engine=29 service=29 app=29 merged=29` + PASS → J1 is CLOSED. Update
  this doc (§3b round-3 entry → "verified PASS <date>"), commit, push. Done.
- Rows still missing → find which takes lost rows:

```sh
cd "$HOME/Library/Application Support/QwenVoice-Debug/diagnostics" && python3 - <<'EOF'
import json
def ids(p):
    out = {}
    for line in open(p):
        try:
            r = json.loads(line); out[r["generationID"]] = r.get("recordedAt", "")
        except Exception: pass
    return out
eng = ids("engine/generations.jsonl"); svc = ids("engine-service/generations.jsonl"); app = ids("app/generations.jsonl")
for i, (g, t) in enumerate(sorted(eng.items(), key=lambda kv: kv[1]), 1):
    f = ("" if g in svc else " NO-SVC") + ("" if g in app else " NO-APP")
    if f: print(f"take#{i} {t} {g}{f}")
EOF
```

  Then apply the NEXT lever, already scoped: make
  `GenerationTelemetryJSONLSink.write` synchronous (await, not detached) when
  `QWENVOICE_UI_TEST_HOOKS=1` — touch ONLY the write scheduling, re-run the same
  bench-ui command, expect 29/29/29/29. All prior J1 fixes are described in §3b; do
  not revert them.

### Step 2 — iOS bench-ui shakeout (needs the phone: mirror ACTIVE, unlocked)

Preconditions and full procedure: `docs/reference/testing-runbook.md` §3b (iOS).
Quick loop:

```sh
scripts/ios_device.sh device-state          # must print MIRROR_ACTIVE / exit 0
scripts/ios_device.sh bench-ui --modes custom --lengths short --warm 1 --label shakeout
```

- PASS (gate prints per-cell row + PASS) → lane works; go to Step 3.
- Install error `CoreDeviceError 3002` / `Connection interrupted` → phone
  locked/unreachable; ask the user to unlock + keep the mirror active, retry ONCE.
- A take times out → grep the log for `iosStudio_generationError`; model missing →
  reinstall Custom Voice on the phone (a `gate` run uninstalls it — known behavior).

### Step 3 — Full iOS UI-driven matrix (phone, ~40 min, thermal-sensitive)

```sh
scripts/ios_device.sh bench-ui --label "ios-ui-bench-baseline"
```

Clone cells auto-skip unless a saved voice is enrolled ON the phone (mic does not
work through Mirroring — ask the user to enroll one via Voices → Save a new voice).
On PASS: append one HISTORY.md row per mode cell (medium/warm) with the label, and
record the run dir in this doc. Numbers should match §1b (RTF 1.6–1.9, 0 trims);
>5% RTF drop vs those references = investigate before committing anything.

### Step 4 — Design-mode listening pass (HUMAN ears; cannot be automated)

Takes live in the app's History on the phone. Ask the user to listen to the design
takes for dropouts/clicks. If audible: file the defect with the chunkTimeline row
(v5 telemetry localizes the silence window) BEFORE touching engine code.

### Step 5 — Release train (Phase 5; only after Steps 1–4 are green)

```sh
QWENVOICE_GATE_BENCH=1 scripts/macos_test.sh gate   # PASS required
scripts/ios_device.sh gate                          # PASS required (attended)
scripts/macos_test.sh review && scripts/ios_device.sh review   # diff vs baselines
```

Then follow `docs/reference/macos-release-qa.md` (version bump in `project.yml` →
`regenerate_project.sh` → tag → GitHub release triggers the DMG workflow). iOS
TestFlight lane is optional (`archive-ios` manual dispatch).

## 3. Guardrails (learned the hard way — do not violate)

From the post-mortem (repo-fatal):

- **Never** build simulator/fake-engine test tiers for iOS. On-device only.
- **Never** rewrite agent guides per harness/model. AGENTS.md is the single guide.
- **Never** land multi-hundred-line features without `macos_test.sh gate` /
`ios_device.sh gate` first. Reverts = planning failure.
- **Never** float `mlx-swift`/`mlx-swift-lm` pins independently or without a
benchmark-gated throwaway branch.

From this rescue (operational traps that WILL bite again):

- **LaunchServices double-instance trap:** never `tell application "Vocello" to activate` / `open -na` while a measured debug session runs — it can spawn a second
instance WITHOUT debug mode whose takes land in the user's real library.
`uitest_measure.sh prep/activate/finish` handle this correctly (persisted DebugMode
flag + PID-based activation + single-instance guard).
- **logd flush lag:** `log show` exposes fresh os_signpost events minutes late. Wait
on the history.sqlite row (what `bench-wait` does), never poll `log show --last Nm`.
- `log show --start` **rejects fractional seconds** — trim to whole seconds.
- **xcodebuild env:** plain env vars do NOT reach the test runner; use the
`TEST_RUNNER_` prefix (review lanes do), and expect on-device runners to be unable
to write Mac paths (use the xcresult-attachment fallback).
- **Engine JSONL auto-prunes oldest-first** — never isolate a run's rows by line
count; filter by `recordedAt` (gate bench) or the run label.
- **bash 3.2 +** `set -u`**:** expanding an empty array errors; use
`${arr[@]+"${arr[@]}"}`.
- **New/deleted Swift files require** `./scripts/regenerate_project.sh` before the
Xcode build sees them.
- **French macOS localization:** the Mirroring process is "Recopie de l'iPhone" —
mirroir needs `~/.mirroir-mcp/settings.json` (done on this machine); the device-state
OCR keyword sets are fr+en (`scripts/lib/ios_device_state.sh`).
- **RTF = audioSeconds/wallSeconds — HIGHER is better.** A drop is the regression.
- **Benches need an idle machine** — a concurrent xcodebuild contaminated a full
matrix (design/long 0.57 vs 1.11 idle). Check `pgrep -x xcodebuild` first.
- **devicectl** `screenIsLocked` **does not exist** on Xcode 26.6/iOS 26.5 — the visual
device-state probe is the authoritative interference signal.
- **iOS model downloads are SERIAL (concurrent disabled — maintainer, 2026-07-02):**
tapping Install on a second model while one downloads queues it; it starts after the
first completes. Not a stuck download. The maintainer rates the iOS download process
"in poor shape" — treat download-UX polish as a backlog item; do not enable
concurrency as a quick fix.
- **Driving the mirrored phone from the Mac (attended installs):** peekaboo `see`
cannot map elements inside the Mirroring window (video stream, no AX tree). See via
`screencapture -x -o -l $(swift scripts/lib/mirror_state_ocr.swift window-id)`, then
peekaboo `click` with screen coords (window origin/size from peekaboo `see PID:<mirroring-pid>`; screenshot px = 2× window points). Focus the app first
(`app focus`); a paused mirror shows "Connexion en pause" — click Reprendre to resume.
- **The iPhone MICROPHONE is unavailable through iPhone Mirroring** ("Le micro de
l'iPhone n'est pas disponible à partir du Mac", verified 2026-07-02). Voice
recording/enrollment is NOT broken in the app — it works when operated directly on the
phone (maintainer-confirmed same day). Never triage recording as an app defect from a
mirror session, and never drive record/enroll flows via the mirror; that step is
attended, on the physical phone.

## 3b. Active work (2026-07-02 afternoon)

- **iOS gate: PASS** (all 4 steps; all three Speed models installed on the phone).
  iOS single-take benches green: custom RTF 1.89 / design 1.99 / clone 1.68, physFoot
  2.4–3.2 GB, 0 trims, QC pass. Design dropout did NOT reproduce; the perceptual
  listening pass on the History takes is still owed by the maintainer.
- **"Recording broken" report RESOLVED — not an app defect.** The mic is unavailable
  through iPhone Mirroring (see guardrail above); works on the physical phone.
- **iOS UI-driven bench (`ios_device.sh bench-ui`) — NEW, shakeout in progress.**
  Parts: `VocelloiOSBenchUITests` (matrix driver; corpus must stay identical to
  `BenchMatrixSpec.corpus`), `IOSStudioBenchHooks` (env-gated markers + hidden
  clear-script button), driver verb in `ios_device.sh`, gate
  `scripts/check_ios_ui_bench.py` (expected count comes from the test's
  `VOCELLO-BENCH-UI-MANIFEST ran=N` line — clone cells skip without a saved voice).
  Shakeout command: `scripts/ios_device.sh bench-ui --modes custom --lengths short
  --warm 1 --label shakeout`. If takes fail: check the marker ids exist (hooks env),
  the keyboard-dismiss `\n` step, and `textInput_generateButton` hittability.
- **macOS XPC bench-ui J1 — round 3 pending verification.** Round 1: per-take flush
  wait (was matching the previous take). Round 2: `MacUITestSurfaceMarkers` made
  `@Observable` (plain statics never invalidated SwiftUI, markers were frozen at
  "none"). Round 3 (uncommitted with 1+2): merger poll 3 s → 15 s + `.utility`
  priority for merger and app-layer JSONL write (background-priority writes were
  starved past the relaunch under bench load; takes #10/#29 — the two takes followed
  by a relaunch/terminate — lost their app/service rows twice in a row). Verify:
  `scripts/macos_test.sh bench-ui --label j1-verify` → expect 29/29/29/29 gate PASS.
